# Jarvis.py
An AI Assistant, just like Jarvis(not that perfect) which runs through voice commands and performs basic functions. It uses speechRecognition library and python's pyaudio library for recognizing the user's voice. For web functioning, I have used the Library known as Webbrowser and Wikipedia. The Datetime library has also been used here if the user asks for it. 
I have a windows OS, that's I used pyttsx3's sapi5 package which is available only on windows pc's. It is also able to send mails to the given email address in the code using smptlib library.
